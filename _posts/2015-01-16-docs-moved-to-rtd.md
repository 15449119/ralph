Hi! We have moved our docs to Read The Docs! Yay!

Ralph is an umbrella term for three distinct projects forming its functionality. Therefore each one of them has its own documentation:

* [Ralph (core)](http://ralph.readthedocs.org)
* [Ralph Assets](http://ralph-assets.readthedocs.org)
* [Ralph Pricing](http://ralph-pricing.readthedocs.org) (a.k.a. "Scrooge")]
