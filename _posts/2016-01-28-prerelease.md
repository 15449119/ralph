After many months of development, we make Raph 3.x accessible to everybody. 

Raph 3.x breaks with Ralph 2.x compatibility, bringing many advantages:

* well integrated, and easy to use system(one assets view with pluggable tabs, menu)
* no more assets-core dualizm, one data model
* extremely simple interface without separate admin/ user interface
* rewritten in Python 3.x, and Django 1.8
* new workflow system
* new import/export system
* undo functionality
* much improved dc visualization 
* per-field, flexible permissions system
* pdf generation rewritten as a simple to install microservice
* quick-search field
* other improvements

Note: We don't provide scan and costs-related functionality yet.  It's the subject of Ralph 3.1 to come.

All beta-testers are welcome ! [Installation instructions](/ralph/installation)
