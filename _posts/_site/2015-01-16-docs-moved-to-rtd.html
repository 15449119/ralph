<p>Hi! We have moved our docs to Read The Docs! Yay!</p>

<p>Ralph is an umbrella term for three distinct projects forming its functionality. Therefore each one of them has its own documentation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://ralph.readthedocs.org">Ralph (core)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://ralph-assets.readthedocs.org">Ralph Assets</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://ralph-pricing.readthedocs.org">Ralph Pricing</a> (a.k.a. “Scrooge”)</li>
</ul>
