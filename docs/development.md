# Development and contributing to Ralph

Like every open-source project Ralph is always looking for motivated individuals to contribute to source code.

Please read [this document](https://github.com/allegro/ralph/blob/ng/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.


## In a nutshell

This is how you fix a bug or add a feature in few quick steps:

1. fork us on [GitHub](https://github.com/allegro/ralph/),
2. checkout your fork,
3. write a code (with [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) rules), test, commit,
4. push changes to your fork,
5. open a pull request.


## Add extra view to admin

A extra view is the most convenient way to integrate content from another Django app into a Ralph admin page. All registred views will be represented by tab on admin site.

You must write your own class view and template. There are two possibilities to add extra view: by decorator and by class' attribute.

### Your view

It must be normal view (CBV) inherited from ``RalphListView`` or ``RalphDetailView`` (it depends on view purpose).

#### RalphListView

This class is dedicated for listing view.

#### RalphDetailView

This class is dedicated for details view. Instance of class provides additional attributes:

- ``model`` - actual model class,
- ``object`` - concrete object, fetched from ``model`` and ``id``.

You have access from template to ``object``.

### Template

Each templates must extends from ``BASE_TEMPLATE``.

Basic template:
```django
{% extends BASE_TEMPLATE %}

{% block content %}
    {{ var }}
{% endblock %}
```

Your templates must be placed in one of predefined path:

- ``model/name.html``
- ``app_label/model/name.html``

Where:

- ``app_label`` - is ``app_label`` extracted from ``model``,
- ``model`` - lowercase name of ``model``,
- ``name`` - name of view gets from view's instance.

### Register view via class atrribiute

**Note:** Use this method if you developing directly in Ralph.

in ``admin.py``:
```python3
from ralph.admin import RalphAdmin, register
from ralph.admin.views import RalphDetailView
from ralph.back_office.models import Warehouse


class ExtraView(RalphDetailView):
    name = 'extra_list'
    label = 'Extra Detail View'


@register(Warehouse)
class WarehouseAdmin(RalphAdmin):
    change_views = [ExtraView]
```

### Register view via decorator

**Note:** This method is recommended for external application.

somewhere in your application:
```python3
from ralph.admin.decorators import register_extra_view
from ralph.admin.views import RalphDetailView
from ralph.back_office.models import Warehouse


@register_extra_view(Warehouse, register_extra_view.CHANGE)
class ExtraView(RalphDetailView):
    name = 'extra_details'
    label = 'Extra Detail View'
```
